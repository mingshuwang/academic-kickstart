since 2007, China has become the nation with the highest amount of CO<sub>2</sub>>2 emissions.

###### Carbon Emission Data for China
There are three gridded carbon emissions datasets available for China, namely the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research ([EDGAR](http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/)), the Fossil Fuel Data Assimilation System ([FFDAS](http://www.gurneylab.org/portfolio-item/ffdas/)), and the China High Resolution Emission Gridded Data ([CHRED](http://www.cityghg.com/)).

Data|Temporal Span|Spatial Resolution|Spatial Coverage
----|-------------|------------------|----------------
EDGAR|1970--2012|0.1° × 0.1°|Global|
FFDAS|1997--2011|0.1° × 0.1°|Global|
CHRED|2007,2012|10 km × 10 km,1 k m× 1 km|China


- We compared against energy census data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC) at the province level.

- EDGAR and FFDAS are compared with CHRED at the prefectural level.
