**Polycentric urban development** refers to different forces causing multiple previously close-by but independent urban sub-divisions to become a larger and more integrated **urban system**. **Polycentricity** is oftentimes deemed a desirable urban form, generating greater agglomeration externalities as well as facilitating the achievement of social, economic, and environmental goals. Polycentric urban development has been observed and analyzed at various geographical scales, including the **intra-urban** (e.g., Central Business Districts (CBDs), edge cities, and satellite towns within a city), and **inter-urban** (e.g., the ‘Pearl River Delta’ mega-city region) scales.

Despite much insightful work on polycentric urban development in China, there is a lack of systematic comparison at either scale. Therefore, in this project, we identified polycentric urban structure and quantified the degree of polycentricity in China at both **intra-urban** scale (i.e., [318 Chinese cities]({{< ref "publication/land2016.md" >}})) and **inter-urban** scale (i.e., [22 City-Regions]({{< ref "publication/epb2017.md" >}})) using detailed gridded population data, [U.S. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)'s LandScan](https://landscan.ornl.gov/) dataset.



### Chinese cities at prefecture level and above
![Chinese cities at prefecture level and above.](/img/LAND2016.jpg)

- Over 90% of cities have four or fewer intra-urban (sub)centers.

- Higher degree of polycentricity is found in mountainous cities.

- Polycentricity is positively associated with GDP per capita in **Eastern** China.

- Identified patterns of centers in a number of cities are largely consistent with corresponding master plans.

## Polycentric Urban Regions (PURs) in China

- A typology of Chinese PURs is presented based on the average **intra-urban** polycentricity and **inter-urban** polycentricity, where there is only **limited** levels of association between inter-urban and inter-urban polycentricity.
- The Pearl River Delta and Yangtze River Delta have high levels of both **intra-urban** and **inter-urban** polycentricity.
- Most PURs in Central and Western China are characterized by a
primate urban system and low levels of inter-urban polycentricity.
