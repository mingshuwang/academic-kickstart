# Biography

Dr. Mingshu Wang (王明舒) is a tenure-track Assistant Professor of **Geodata Science** at the [Department of Geo-information Processing](https://www.itc.nl/about-itc/organization/scientific-departments/geo-information-processing/), Faculty of Geo-information Science and Earth Observation (ITC), University of Twente, the Netherlands. His research focuses on developing and applying methods of **GIScience** (i.e., geographical information systems, remote sensing, and spatial analysis) and **big data analytics** (e.g., machine learning, artificial intelligence, and econometrics) to understand **urban systems**. He has two interconnected research lines of cities from the perspective of **people**. At a macro-scale, he quantifies the relationship between urban structure and urban/regional performance from fine-grained geospatial data via GIScience and econometrics methods. At a micro-scale, he examines human mobility issues regarding the built environment with crowdsourced geospatial information using machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. He has received research grants from World Bank, Dutch Research Council (NWO), Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Microsoft Azure Research Award.
