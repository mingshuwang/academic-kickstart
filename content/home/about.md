# Biography

Dr. Mingshu Wang (王明舒) is a tenure-track Assistant Professor of **Geodata Science** at the [Department of Geo-information Processing, Faculty of Geo-information Science and Earth Observation (**ITC**)](https://www.itc.nl/about-itc/organization/scientific-departments/geo-information-processing/), University of Twente, the Netherlands.

His research focuses on developing and applying methods of **GIScience** (i.e., geographical information systems, remote sensing, and spatial analysis) and **big data analytics** (e.g., machine learning, artificial intelligence, and econometrics) to understand sustainable urban systems and urban development. He has two interconnected research lines of cities from the perspective of **people**. Adopting the same interdisciplinary and computational philosophy, his two interconnected people-oriented research lines study cities from different scales. At a macro-scale, he quantifies urban structure and city performance via GIScience methods to find sustainable urban development regime. At a micro-scale, he explores various human mobility issues when people move intra- and inter-city with crowdsourced unstructured geospatial data generated from citizens using machine learning and artificial intelligence methods.
